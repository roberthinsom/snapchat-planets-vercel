This new functionality is available exclusively to Snapchat Plus subscribers and offers a fun way to track your closest friendships on the platform. If you’ve ever wondered about the mysterious "planets" that appear on your friend’s profiles, read on to discover the order, meaning, and how to use this feature to better understand your friendships.</p>

            <h2>What is Snapchat Planets?</h2>
            <p>Snapchat Planets is a fun, visual feature that shows your position in your friend’s “solar system” based on your interaction levels with them. The feature works similarly to the solar system, where each planet represents a friend, and your position as a planet reflects the frequency and quality of your interactions with that person.</p>
            <p>There are <strong>8 planets</strong> in the Snapchat solar system, each representing one of your <strong>top 8 best friends</strong>. Your rankings are based on how often you chat, share snaps, or maintain streaks with a particular friend. The more active you are with someone, the higher their ranking in your system.</p>
            <p>In essence, if you're frequently interacting with someone, you may find yourself as their <strong>Mercury</strong>, signifying the strongest friendship.</p>

            <h2>Purpose of Snapchat Planets</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Snapchat Planets</strong> feature was introduced to visually rank your friendships, offering a creative way to track and celebrate how close you are to the people you care about. This feature encourages users to interact more with their closest friends, whether through streaks, chatting, or sharing content. By providing a "planetary" ranking, Snapchat gives users a sense of progression and helps foster stronger relationships.</p>
            <p>As with a real solar system, your position relative to others in this system reflects how much you’ve engaged with them. If you’re ranked as <strong>Earth</strong>, for example, it suggests that you're in the top three friends of your friend’s profile.</p>

            <h2>How Does the Snapchat Planets System Work?</h2>
            <p>Understanding the Snapchat Planets system is simple once you know how the ranking works. It all comes down to your level of interaction with your friends. The more active you are with someone, the higher their position in your solar system. Here’s a simple breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Streaks and Chats:</strong> The more you interact with someone through chats, snaps, and streaks, the more likely they are to rank higher in your system.</li>
                <li><strong>Position Based on Friendship Level:</strong> For instance, if you share a <strong>7000-day streak</strong> with one friend, a <strong>5000-day streak</strong> with another, and a <strong>3000-day streak</strong> with a third, they will be placed in the system accordingly:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>7000 days</strong> = <strong>Mercury</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>5000 days</strong> = <strong>Venus</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>3000 days</strong> = <strong>Earth</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The system helps visualize the strength of your connections in a fun, interactive way.</p>
